        <img align="middle" src="img/Skydiving.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
        <p> I am a data scientist and a mathematician. I love playing Dota 2 and read celebrity news in my spare time. I have a life-long passion for solving puzzles. I love solving high school math competition because it helps me build intuition without the need to memorize a bunch of theorems. I often watch Raytheon MATHCOUNTS on youtube, pause the video to solve the math and answer them as if I am faster than other competitors. This is my secret getaway from imposter syndrome. </p>
        <p> I think machine learning is one of the four pillars of scientific methods and this is my train of thought about the field. </p>
        <p> The development of cloud computing, data storage, and GPU have revolutionized data science in the last two decades. With enough hardware power, a deep neural network can detect natural disasters and save thousands of lives daily. This is a problem that can hardly be solved by any traditional machine learning or theoretical statistics. </p>
        <p> It is not wrong to say that data runs the world. Our body is mostly made up of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Every action that we do every day is governed by trillion of atoms interaction within our DNA. The environment that we live plays an important role in influencing our behaviors. The environment is not random but rather an immensely giant closed system of interaction that is beyond human comprehension. In other words, everything happens for a reason and every phenomenon can be theoritically predicted by a mathematical model. </p>
        Consequently, the Big Bang is created by a Creator who can safely be considered as a mathematician who invented the "theory of everything". Contrastly, we, humans, can only originate mathematics by our inferiorly logical building blocks, the mathematical axioms! This restrict our ability to only study physical properties that do not contradict the law of science. String theory is a good example of this notion. It was created to unify quantum mechanics and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. However, the progress on string theory had been patchy in the previous year due to the incabality to provide evidence of the extra dimentions that the theory once proposed. </p>
        <p> Statistics, on the other hand, is uncertainty tolerable. Will a first-generation immigrant college student like me finish graduate school?  There are millions of confounding factors that make this question extremely complicated. If not for statistics no one could not make any predictions at all. Statistics is powerful on its own, but artificial intelligence takes it to a whole different level.  Data-driven technology nowadays has exceeded human capacity in many areas, for example:
        <ul>
          <li> In 2014, NVIDIA researchers discovered Generative Adversarial Networks which can generate synthetical human faces. The products look so real that California had to pass a bill that bans the use of GAN to make fake pornography without consent. What if I tell you these people below do not exist? </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/Fake_image.png" style="max-width:100%;">
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li> In 2018, a group of MIT researchers applied deep neural networks to accurately estimate how a human on the other side of a wall is standing, sitting, or walking just from perturbations in Wifi signals. </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/MIT_wifi.png" style="max-width:100%;">
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li> In 2019, AlphaStar created a reinforcement learning-based AI that beats the top Starcraft pro players. </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/Starcraft.png" style="max-width:100%;">
        <br> <br>

        <p>  All of the great things that AI could do contributed to my decision of suspending a theoretical math degree to pursuit Data Science (God please forgive me!). Though, I did not regret this decision. Data science has given me so many opportunities to spitball business ideas to my friends and senselessly drop it by "I can achieve result A by using machine learning algorithm X."  My friends could not agree with me more.  They keep nodding their head as if machine learning is a magical 'black box'. (Evil face) </p>
        <p> Besides trying to be smart all the time, I truly enjoy the whole process of data science. I could spend days web scraping different websites or sipping gallons of coffee while reading research papers. It would be a shame if I forgot to mention Kaggle. This is a very fun place where I can rank up my data science tier just like Dota 2. I can also compete to win money and recognition. Especially, Kaggle is a nonjudgmental place where I can learn from the brightest data scientists from all over the world. </p>
        <p>  I am currently on the job hunt. It feels very exciting but daunting at the same time. All the company requires me to have experience before I get to experience. I can only plant my seed of hope on a job offer by sharpening up my skills and applying for jobs everywhere. Statistically speaking, I will get a job eventually. If this ever happens, I am looking forward to being in a place that I can turn my craziest ideas into reality and data into real gold. </p>
